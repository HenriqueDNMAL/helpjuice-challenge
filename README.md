Hello Helpjuyice team, hope you guys are doing great.
Here's a summary of what I have done:
1st - Did all the stuff to create a new project and repository on GitHub (rails new, gh repo, bundle)
2nd - Created the model for Article, Articles controller, the view and its route
3rd - Created the "search" method in the Articles controller, and the search form in the view
4th - Created the JavaScript to handle the autocomplete and be recorded only once to avoid the "pyramid problem"
5th - Created the model for SearchAnalytic, SearchAnalytics controller, the view and its route
6th - Added the record logic to the "search" method to store the inputs
7th - Created the "index" method in the SearchAnalytics controller, to display analytics based on the inputs on a dashboard
8th - Created the validations and test of both models, and also the SearchAnalytics controller
9th - Deployed on Heroku to test it live
