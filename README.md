Hello Helpjuyice team, hope you guys are doing great. Here's a summary of what I have done:

## Summary

### Initial Setup
1. Created a new project and repository on GitHub using:
   - `rails new`
   - `gh repo`
   - `bundle`

### Article Model
2. Created the Article model, Articles controller, view, route, and seed.

### Search Functionality
3. Added the `search` method in the Articles controller and the search form in the view.

### Autocomplete Feature
4. Implemented JavaScript to handle autocomplete, ensuring it records only once to avoid the "pyramid problem."

### Search Analytics
5. Created the SearchAnalytic model, SearchAnalytics controller, view, and route.

### Record Logic
6. Added logic to the `search` method to store the inputs.

### Analytics Dashboard
7. Implemented the `index` method in the SearchAnalytics controller to display analytics based on the inputs on a dashboard.

### Validations and Tests
8. Created validations and tests for both models and the SearchAnalytics controller.

### Deployment

### Live Server Adjustments
10. Made configurations and adjustments on the live server.
